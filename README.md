# Intermittent Demand Forecasting using iETS Models

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of intermittent demand forecasting using innovation state space models for Intermittent Exponential Smoothing (iETS). The model is particularly effective for handling sporadic and irregular demand patterns commonly found in spare parts inventory management, retail, and maintenance operations.
It is based on the smooth package in R
